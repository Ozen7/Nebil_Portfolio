# Nebil Ozer - Portfolio Code

This was a 3-4 week project that spanned the last week of December 2022 to the second Week of January 2023, and is my attempt at building a custom web portfolio for myself using React JS and various related libraries. The portfolio is not complete at the moment, with placeholder images and text, but the flow and feel of the page is complete.

I will return to this project in the summer of 2023, and update it to reflect my most recent accomplishments, before using it in my applications for a Summer 2024 internship or research opportunity.
