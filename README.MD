# Data Visualization Website

## Goals:
Currently my goals for this project are the following:

1) Create a good-looking website that is able to visualize data in multiple ways

2) allow for data to be saved on said website either based on device being used, or through a login

3) Allow for users to download GRAPHS and DATA after having saved it to the website.

## How will this be achieved?

- I fully intend to use either React JS and Plotly, or Flask and Matplotlib for the frontend (i am unsure as to the feasibility of these ideas as of right now)

- The backend (saving) will be done using SQL. 

- This project will mostly just be something I work on in the background.
